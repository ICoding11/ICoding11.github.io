        <p>The immaculate Conception LaSalle is a clisson college that offers multiple activities
            <br> and associations. The Immaculate Conception is the conception of the Virgin Mari "without blemish", that is,
            <br> it is a dogma of the Catholic Church that was proclaimed, on December 8, 1854 by Pope Pius IX by the bull Ineffabilis Deus.
            <br> But the immaculate conception that I will show you includes several activities. 
        <br><br>It is directed by Guillaume Dessein who takes care of the primary and
        <br> Laurence de Saint Quentin who takes care of the college.</p>
